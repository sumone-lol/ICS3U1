4. A common and useful function provides the ability to swap two values. This
concept is used frequently when sorting values. Write a function called
swap(a,b) that will take two real values as parameters, and the function will
then exchange the values and print them out. Test your program with these
values: swap(3, 5) and swap("Boo", "Hoo")
'''

def swap(a, b):
    print(b, a)

swap(3, 5)
swap("Boo", "Hoo")
