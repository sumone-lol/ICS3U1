Compare these two programs. What do the programs output AND which program
do you think is more efficient

Program A:
x = int(input("Enter a value for x: "))
y = int(input("Enter a value for y: "))
z = int(input("Enter a value for z: "))

if (x >= y):                # y isn't biggest
    if (x >= z):            # y, z not biggest
        print("x is the biggest")
    else:                   # y, x not biggest
        print("z is the biggest")
elif (y >= z):              # x, z not biggest
    print("y is the biggest")
else:                       # x, y not biggest
    print("z is the biggest")



Program B:
x = int(input("Enter a value for x: "))
y = int(input("Enter a value for y: "))
z = int(input("Enter a value for z: "))

if (x >= y) and (x >= z): # x is biggest
    print("x is the biggest")
elif (y >= z): # x isn't biggest
    print("y is the biggest")
else: # x, y not biggest
    print("z is the biggest")



Both programs ask the user for three numbers (internally stored as integers) 
and output a response stating the largest number of the three. Program A uses 
nested if statements while program B uses logical operators to combine 
conditions. I think program B is more efficient because the conditions are 
compared in a single if statement rather than two separate ones. Nested ifs 
can allow for more complex decision structure with multiple possible branches, 
but that is not necessary for this particular use case.
