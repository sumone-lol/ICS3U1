By definition, natural resources can be found in any environment. Continuing from the previous examples, 
wood can be harvested from dense forests, water can be pumped from aquifers and rivers, and minerals and 
metals can be extracted from quarries. However, many of these environments and ecosystems are being 
adversely affected by the overconsumption and pollution of these resources. In the past century, it has 
become increasingly important to preserve what we have left and prevent further degradation.
