Natural resources are useful materials that are created in the environment without human intervention. 
Everything man-made can always be traced back to natural resources, no matter how artificial or processed it 
may seem. Natural resources are often categorized as renewable and non-renewable resources based on the 
duration of synthesis. Renewables typically replenish in the span of a human lifetime whereas non-renewables 
could take upwards of a thousand years.
