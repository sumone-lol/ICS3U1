Yes, we are.
The primary concerns are of non-renewable resources such as petroleum and natural gas, but 
climate change and other factors are impacting renewables as well. For instance, forest fires reduce the 
amount of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, accelerating climate change and contributing to more forest 
fires in a positive feedback loop. And increasingly recently, AI data centres are using billions of cubic 
meters of drinking water per year and straining our current infrastructure.
