'''
1. Write a program that asks two questions: the userâ€™s name and age. This 
information should be outputted using one or two nicely formatted sentences. 
For example, if the user enters the name "John" and the age "16", the program 
might output, "Hello John. I see that you are 16 years old."
'''

name = input("What is your name?\n")
age = int(input("What is your age?\n"))

print(name, "is", age, "years old.")
